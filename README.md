# World_Weather_Analysis

Purpose: Create dataframes for betatesters to use the within the PlanMyTrip app to plan vacations with input statements. 
         Input statements allow client to filter the data for weather preferences, in turn identifying potential travel destinations and hotels. 
         The betatester then chooses four cities from the list of potential travel destinations using the search parameters in the dataframes created. 
         A travel itinerary will then be created using Geoapify Routing API and a travel route and marker layer map will be created.
